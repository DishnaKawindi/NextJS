Next JS

Implements react components to client and server components. Default option is server components. Need to define client components specifically.

To create a NextJS project
--> npx create-next-app@latest
Give a project name
TypeScript Yes
ESLint Yes
Tailwind CSS Yes
'src/directory' No
App Router Yes
Turbopack Yes
import alias No

To run the project
--> npm run dev

NextJS provides static routing. A file based routing system.
Create a folder named 'about' then create new page.tsx file within it.
Now go to the browser and type http://localhost:3000/about. This will automatically go to the about page.

But dynamic routing is still needed. Ex: for viewing user profiles. /users/user-1, users/user-2 etc.
